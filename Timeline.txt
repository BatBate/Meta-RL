# RL
Course project for Deep RL

9 Weeks in total
Reserve 1 week for reporting stuff

Week 1: Read PyTorch source code for SNAIL and TensorFlow source code for LSTM
  - SNAIL paper 
  - A3C paper
  
Week 2: Study and implement basic building blocks for both Model
  - TODO: DenseBlock, TCBlock, AttentionBlock
  - TODO: Read code: Learning to reinforcement learning :https://github.com/liampetti/A3C-LSTM, 
  - TODO: Read code: Temporal CNN: https://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn
  - TODO: Read code: Learning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent:
